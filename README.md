# Endeavor Snake
Prototype designed and built by Daisy Shah as 2023 Internship Project
## Introduction
Endeavor Snake is a prototype designed to test the viability of gamifying the onboarding process at Endeavor Global, and possibly eventually across local offices. The program uses gaming to convey information in a more engaging and memorable way, something especially valuable during an employee's onboarding process, when they are given high volumes of "homework" to read up on as they prepare for their new role.
